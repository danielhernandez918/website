                <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Hernandez.  I am a student at Coding Dojo and previously employed as an accountant.  Not satisfied with repetitive the nature of accounting, I started looking into new career prospects.  Last summer, programming took my interest and I started self-studying Python before enrolling in Coding Dojo six months later.</p> 
                <br/>
                <p>I find programming to be challenging but also entertaining in which problems can be solved in multiple ways. </p>
